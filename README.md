# LRU Caching Algorithm

This project was made as part of the course "Construction and Analsys of Algorithms 2" which I am enrolled into, on my pursuit towards Master's degree

## Installation

LRU Cache requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd kiaa-lru
npm i
npm run dev
```

After the project builds, go to your browser and visit: http://localhost:5173

You can run tests by executing the following command:

```sh
npm run test
```

Some basic benchmarking was provided so that we ensure that the algorithm runs and behaves as we state in the paper. You can run benchmarks by executing the following command:

```sh
npm run benchmark
```
